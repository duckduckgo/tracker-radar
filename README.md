# DuckDuckGo Tracker Radar

This data set consists of the most common cross-site trackers with data about their tracking behavior. It allows for easy custom solutions with the significant metadata it has for trackers: parent entity, prevalence, use of fingerprinting, cookies, privacy policy, and performance. The data on individual tracker domains can be found in the [domains](/domains) directory.
